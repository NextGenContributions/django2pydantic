Your goal is to complement the existing tests with new tests to have 100% test coverage.

## Instructions
- Run the tests like you normally would (we hacked copilot extension to provide coverage info)
- Run the tests after each time you fix or implement a new test. One test at a time.
- Output and tell us about the coverage percentage after each test run
